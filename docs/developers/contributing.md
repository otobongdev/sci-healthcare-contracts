# Contributing to SCI Healthcare Contracts

Thanks for helping. This repo holds the Soroban contracts, so changes here move
real escrowed value — the bar is deliberately high.

## Before you start

1. Comment on the issue you want and wait to be assigned, so two people do not
   build the same thing.
2. If you are proposing a design change rather than fixing a defect, open an
   issue first and agree the approach before writing code.

## Setup

```bash
rustup toolchain install 1.96.0
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
cargo install --locked stellar-cli
cargo test
```

The toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Please do not change it in a
feature PR.

## Non-negotiables

These are the rules a review will fail you on.

- **No patient health information on chain, ever.** Service codes stay coarse
  categories. `beneficiary_ref` stays an opaque 32 bytes. If a change would let
  anyone infer a diagnosis, a result, or an identity from ledger data, it will
  be rejected regardless of how useful it is.
- **No `unwrap()` or `expect()` outside `#[cfg(test)]`.** Return a
  `#[contracterror]` variant instead.
- **No floating point.** Money is `i128` in the token's smallest unit. Fees are
  basis points with integer division, and truncation must favour the provider,
  never the protocol.
- **Use checked arithmetic** on anything that could overflow. `MathOverflow`
  exists for this.
- **Extend TTL on every persistent read and write.** An entry that expires is an
  entry that has silently lost user funds.
- **`require_auth()` on the acting address**, and check role membership
  separately. Authenticating is not the same as being authorised.
- **Every new function needs tests for the failure paths**, not just the happy
  one. Look at how existing tests assert specific error variants.

## Commits

Conventional commits, one logical change per commit:

```
feat(voucher): add partial refund for over-funded vouchers
fix(registry): reject a two-character country code containing digits
test(receipt): cover minting after a minter rotation
docs(readme): correct the deploy order
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `perf`.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main`, named `feat/short-description` or `fix/short-description`.
- `cargo test` and `cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release` must both pass.
- `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` must be clean.
- Describe **what breaks if this is wrong**, not just what you changed.
- If you changed an event's fields, say so explicitly — the indexer in
  `sci-healthcare-backend` decodes events by name, and moving a field between
  topic and data is a breaking change that needs a matching PR there.

## Adding a contract event

Events are part of the public interface. When adding or changing one:

1. Define it with `#[contractevent]` in the contract's `events.rs`.
2. Mark fields `#[topic]` only if they should be indexable. Topic fields are
   published in the topic list, **not** in the data map.
3. Update `TOPIC_FIELDS` in `sci-healthcare-backend/src/stellar/events.ts` in the
   same change set, and open a linked PR there.

## Wave program

Issues carry a complexity label that maps to Wave points: `trivial` (100),
`medium` (150), `high` (200). Please read the
[Wave rules](https://docs.drips.network/wave/terms-and-rules/) — in particular,
low-effort or unreviewed LLM-generated submissions are explicitly disallowed and
will be closed. Understand what you submit and test it.
