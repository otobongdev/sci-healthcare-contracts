# How a voucher works

A voucher is one commitment to pay one clinic for one service. It moves through a fixed set of states, and every transition is a contract call that someone specific is authorised to make.

```
                 claim              attest             settle
  Funded ──────────────> Claimed ───────────> Attested ────────> Settled
    │                       │                     │
    │ refund                │ dispute             │ dispute
    │ (past expiry)         ▼                     ▼
    ▼                    Disputed <───────────────┘
 Refunded  <──── resolve ────┴──── resolve ────> Settled
```

`Settled` and `Refunded` are terminal. Nothing leaves them.

## The states

### Funded

The funder has called `create_voucher`. USDC has moved from their account into the contract. The voucher records the clinic, the service code, the amount, an expiry, and an opaque beneficiary reference.

Before accepting the money the contract checks three things: the clinic is `Active` in the registry, the clinic actually offers that service, and the amount is at least the listed price. If any fails, nothing moves.

**Who can act:** the clinic can `claim`. After expiry, anyone can `refund`.

### Claimed

The patient turned up and the clinic called `claim`. This is the clinic saying "this person is in front of me", not "I have been paid".

A voucher cannot be claimed after it expires.

**Who can act:** an attester can `attest`. The funder can `dispute`.

### Attested

An attester has confirmed the care was delivered. This starts the dispute window — 72 hours in the production configuration.

The contract refuses this call from the clinic that is going to be paid.

**Who can act:** the funder can `dispute` until the window closes. After it closes, anyone can `settle`.

### Settled

The dispute window closed and `settle` ran. The clinic received the amount less the protocol fee, the fee went to the fee account, and a care receipt was minted.

`settle` takes no authorisation. This is deliberate: a clinic that has delivered care and been attested should never have to chase the funder, or us, to be paid.

### Disputed

The funder contested the claim. Funds stay in escrow until the admin resolves it in favour of one party or the other. The admin cannot send the money anywhere else.

### Refunded

Either the voucher expired unclaimed, or a dispute was resolved in the funder's favour. The **full** amount goes back — no fee is taken on care that did not happen.

## A worked example

Amina, working in London, wants to cover her mother's antenatal visit at a clinic in Lagos.

1. She opens the app, finds the clinic, and picks "Antenatal visit — $5.00".
2. She enters her mother's clinic card number and a secret key. Her browser turns these into an opaque 32-byte reference. Neither the card number nor the key ever leaves her device.
3. She signs one transaction. $5.00 USDC moves into the contract, bound to that clinic, that service, and an expiry 30 days out.
4. Her mother attends. The clinic calls `claim`.
5. A community health worker registered as an attester confirms the visit happened.
6. 72 hours pass with no dispute.
7. Anyone calls `settle`. The clinic receives $4.95. The protocol keeps $0.05.
8. A care receipt is minted against the beneficiary reference. Amina's mother now has verifiable proof that this care was paid for, with no clinical information attached to it.

If her mother never attends, after 30 days Amina calls `refund` and gets the full $5.00 back.
